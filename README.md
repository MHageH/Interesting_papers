## Neuromorphic engineering

**Neuromorphic engineering** is the idea revolving around exploring the ways we can exploit neuro-biological architectures present in the brain and the nervous system in general. The synthesized circuits, inspired from such concepts, can be very efficient in term of power consumption, and reduce the needs for massive amount of energy for calculations, and have other benefits, like building truly cognitive analog-digital mixed circuits.
