## Neuromorphic engineering

**Neuromorphic engineering** is the idea revolving around exploring the ways we can exploit neuro-biological architectures present in the brain and the nervous system in general. The synthesised circuits, inspired from such concepts, can be very efficient in term of power consumption, and reduce the needs for massive amount of energy for calculations, and have other benifits, like building truely cognitive anolog-digital mixed circuits.
